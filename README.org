#+TITLE: the Common Lisp File Manager

* A File Manager Written in Common Lisp
  This is a very regular file manager. It is mainly mouse driven, but the plan is to make it more keyboard oriented. 

** Behaviore
   clicking on an item will either open it via =xdg-open=, or if its a directory it is entered. 

* Quirks
  - In order to leverage the feature of opening another pane as root, CLFM must be in the =$PATH=.
